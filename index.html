						<p style="font-size: 32px;">Heya! I'm Susi. I'm a UCF student going for a computer science and game design dual degree. Games have always been a passion for me, specifically the construction of them. This cacophany of sound, visuals and interactivity is created using just a computer? Sounds perfect for me.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 32px;">
						I plan on designing video game gameplay or art systems, either as a part of a large company or as a solo indie developer. To reach that point, I will develop several portfolio projects while studying and get as many diverse internships as I can for experience.</p>

							<h2 class="inspoText">Michael Cusack</h2>
							<p class="inspoText">Michael Cusack was a Newgrounds animator, eventually growing large enough to get TV programs on Adult Swim. While their quality can wane show to show, episode to episode, it still stands as an achievement for Digital Artists to break into traditional media. His work and commitment paid off as last year he produced Smiling Friends, a single episode spot greenlit into a full show.</p>

							<h2 class="inspoText">Thomas Vasseur</h2>
							<p class="inspoText">Thomas Vasseur is an artist and the Creative Director at Motion Twin, the French game production company for Dead Cells. Vasseur's illustrations are striking to me. They use an uncommon color pallete to great use and can carry a lot of momentum thanks to his artstyle. His art is what I aspire to invoke in my own creative works.</p>

						 	<h2 class="inspoText">Funke</h2>
						 	<p class="inspoText">Funke is a youtuber using a stop-motion-esque avatar. His videos are not only well written, but amazingly self-animated. Utilizing a bold color pallette and stop-motion techniques, it controls tone very well and portrays his avatar very well.</p>
