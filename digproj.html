					<h2>Inkle - Spring 2023</h2>
					<h3>'Welcome to Hell' is a short interactive story project created for my Digital Narratives class. It follows David, a new soul trapped in Hell, but in a surprisingly relaxed environment on Lucifer's lake.</h3>

					<p>My aim with this project was less on the writing itself, but to test out various narrative development styles to improve future workflows.</p>
					<p>I tried methods based around three focuses: choices, endings, and characters</p>
					</div>

					<h2 class="subsectionHeader">
						Choice Based
					</h2>
					<p class="projText">My first method was to base the story on choices, both the characters and world. By shaping character motivations and backstories to cater to the character, we give them a greater sense of control. It also has the drawback feeling of pandering to each audience who may play. It removes focus from the story and discovery of the world to highlight the "gameplay" which in an interactive fiction game, isn't quite exciting.</p>
					<p>It also proved difficult to manage. You're creating new lines and an exponential amount of variables to cover the player's every choice. This was very out of scope for my project, and I believe for any project not shoveled with millions of dollars. An example of this done right however is Detroit: Become Human.</p>
					<p>Because the characters are pure blank slates due to being androids, you shape their motivations and beliefs as you play, particularly Connor, a fan favorite in the community.</p>
					<p>This culminated in my first idea 'Immortal'. A time jumping narrative game where you can change how characters speak to you through future interactions centered in the past. Though I loved the themes I created, this idea doesn't serve itself well to the interactive story medium. It may do well with interactivity, but with more limited choices.</p>
					<h2 class="subsectionHeader">
						Ending based
					</h2>
					<p>I figured, if I can't base it entirely on choices, how about I work backwords from endings. Different cool and separated endings which will intrique the player to replay. It has the ability to be massively branching, giving total freedom of control, but it will have to be a shorter story given the complicated nature.</p>
					<p>Though it seemed like a great idea at first to have such a branching storyline, the design requirements and drawbacks were too hefty. First, the story would be shallow even if it were very engaging. Second, to keep it engaging, I would have to develop a dozen or so unique endings and pre-requisite story paths to reach those points. Third, I would have to keep those story paths connected to allow players to explore them whenever to give freedom. </p>	 
					<p> This culminated in another untitled idea set in an SCP-esque universe, with dangerous monsters hidden by a shadowy organization. You'd play a simple office worker who discovers some of these monsters and are given the overall choice of helping supress threats, become a whistleblower, or side with the gods and monsters to help them accomplish their goals. Overall, it is a cool concept, but once again out of scope of this project. </p>
					<p>If I had to point out a similar game, 'Don't Press The Button' would be my pick. You sit in front of a big red button on a desk, but that desk has many secrets which unravel as you play. You can hop between various paths whenever, giving you a different ending.</p>	
					<h2 class="subsectionHeader">
						Character Based
					</h2>
					<p>The last method I tested was a character based approach, where I flesh out each character and reveal their characters as the player makes choices. Like before you write a book you know what each of the character's needs, wants, desires, regrets and all. I followed a similar approach to create 'Welcome to Hell'.</p>
					<h2 class="Welcome to Hell">
						<p>Welcome to Hell is the culmination of my efforts. There are many mistakes and problems I regret with it, but for my first story I am proud. I deisgned the story and choices around Lucifer himself and the connections people can make.</p>
