						<p>Welcome to Hell is the culmination of my efforts. There are many mistakes and problems I regret with it, but for my first story I am proud. My primary problem with it, is that it is just plain sloppy. I had only found a good workflow after many days of work, leading to a rushed product. I first attempted a choice based story, which lead to many many storylines that I had viewed as shallow, not leaving an impact. The other I attempted was ending based, where I worked backwards from cool ending ideas to build out the story. With both of these attempts, I found it hard to put in dialogue which propelled the internal story, which is my main focus. I feel most external stories are more so excuses to enjoyable investigate someone's internal choices, which in interactive media puts the conflict in the player.</p>
						<p>Although I feel I could have done better, and plan on continuing this project for another class, as of now the primary problem in still depth. I like the character ideas I have, and tried to portray them as best I can within the remaining time period. From here, I plan to flesh out the characters and give more satisfying choice selection, which will still have the same endings, but more medium branches to give individuality to playthroughs.</p>

						<p>This portfolio website was meant to be given as a continuous project, with many in-between submissions of text, HTML5, and/or CSS. HTML5 and CSS is not that difficult, and neither is coding for me personally. However, this website was as a good practice in organization of coding features. Attempting to optimize classes and ids to be both useful and readability took a lot of effort.</p>
						<p>It also took awhile to figure out a working design, figuring out typesettings and a color pallette. For this criteria, I wanted to stand out from many programmers websites by incorporating brighter colors, instead of a constant grey and black. I feel doing that is a bit of a copout on actually working on color balancing. I think I did an alright job with mixing up the color pallette by using desaturated colors, allowing for greater color diversity while keeping eye strain low and readability high.</p>
						<p>In terms of features, I am dissapointed with my navbar. Those things are tough to design. It's asking for major screen real estate, demanding they be up which can throw off the ratio of certain designs. It's my one regret that I cannot think of another way to incorporate it.</p>
